## Disclaimer

Please use mods at your own risk and do not play online matches whilst mods are enabled!

## Patching the game	
	
The game **must** be patched in order to install mods. 	
To do this simply open the DBFZ Mod Manager and click `Disable EasyAntiCheat`, choose Dragon Ball FighterZ from the dropdown and click ninstall. 	
After that click `Patch Exe` and you are all ready to go!	
	
If you ever want to un-patch the game and play online again you can simply go into Steam and [Verify the integrity of the game files](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335). 

## Installing Mods

Currently the best place to get mods for DBFZ is [gamebanana.com](https://gamebanana.com/skins/games/6246).

Once you download any mod you should have a `.zip` or `.rar` file. In the DBFZ Mod Manager click `Add Mod`, browse to the location of the file and select it. 
After that the mod should be installed, just click `Save and Play` to try it out!

Mods can also be installed manually by putting them in the `~mods` folder. Click the `Open Mods Folder` to access this directory.

## Additional Mod Info

Modders can optionally include a .ini file with their mod to add extra information such as Name, Author, Version and Description. This file **must**
have the some name as the `.pak` file (eg BaseGoku.pak would come with a file called BaseGoku.ini). Please see the example below:-

```
Name=Base Goku 
Author=Daniel Griffiths
Description=Adds base Gokus model over SSJ Goku
Version=1.0
```

If no .ini is provider then the DBFZ mod manager will assume the name based on the .pak filename (eg "BaseGoku.pak" becomes "Base Goku"). 

## Gamebanana 1-Click Install Support 

To enable this functionality you **must** run the mod manager as an admin at least once. This is required to register a custom protocol `dbfmm:` with Gamebanana. Once this is done you will be able to install always any mod on Gamebanana with a single click!
